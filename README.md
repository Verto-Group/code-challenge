You are to create a media library app using this laravel app and vue js.
The app must be able to do the following:
* Allows the user to search for images from unsplash

```
    folders:
    - map: {{Add Path to Project Folder on your computer}}
    - to: /home/vagrant/code
```

5. Navigate to the project folder
6. run `composer install`
7. run `vagrant up`
8. run `vagrant ssh` to ssh into the vagrant and naviage to the 'to' folder in your Homestead.yaml file

### Unsplash
To allow access to the Unsplash API you need to register as a developer with unsplash to get access to the API (https://unsplash.com/developers)

### Conclusion
Please respond to us when you have finished with the link to your repo
If you get stuck or have a question please feel free to contact us.

### Review
- Use vagrant v 2.2.10
- Using WSL is not reliable as there is no VM for the WSL
-
